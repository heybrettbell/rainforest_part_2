# This file should contain all the record creation needed to seed the database with its default values.
# The data can then be loaded with the rails db:seed command (or created alongside the database with db:setup).
#
# Examples:
#
  products = Product.create([{ name: 'Red Fidget Spinner', description: 'Red Steel', price_in_cents: 699 }, { name: 'Silver Fidget Spinner', description: 'Lights Up', price_in_cents: 899 }])
